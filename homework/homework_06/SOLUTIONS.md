## Problem 1

> **Note:** code for this problem can be found here: https://github.com/dsifford/CSC_6500/tree/master/homework/homework_06

The assignment with the lowest cost is simply placing every module in processor 2.

### Program Output

```
Brute force:
  Lowest cost = 38
  Best combination = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Monte carlo (10 iterations):
  Lowest cost = 85
  Best combination = [0, 0, 2, 3, 2]
Monte carlo (100 iterations):
  Lowest cost = 47
  Best combination = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
Monte carlo (1000 iterations):
  Lowest cost = 38
  Best combination = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Monte carlo (10000 iterations):
  Lowest cost = 38
  Best combination = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
